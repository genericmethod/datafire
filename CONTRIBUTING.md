## Approach to writing a Pull Request ##

 - Include the purpose of this Pull Request. For example:

> This is a spike to explore… 
> This simplifies the display of… 
> This fixes handling of…

 - Consider providing an overview of why the work is taking place (with
   any relevant links); don’t assume familiarity with the history.
 - Remember that anyone in the company could be reading this Pull
   Request, so the content and tone may inform people other than those
   taking part, now or later.
 - Be explicit about what feedback you want, if any: a quick pair of
   :eyes: on the code, discussion on the technical approach, critique on
   design, a review of copy.
 - Be explicit about when you want feedback, if the Pull Request is work
   in progress, say so. A prefix of “[WIP]” in the title is a simple,
   common pattern to indicate that state.
 - @mention individuals that you specifically want to involve in the   
   discussion, and mention why. (“/cc @jesseplusplus for clarification  
   on this logic”)
 - @mention teams that you want to involve in the discussion, and
   mention why. (“/cc @github/security, any concerns with this
   approach?”)

Offering feedback
-----------------

 - Familiarize yourself with the context of the issue, and reasons why
   this Pull Request exists.
 - If you disagree strongly, consider giving it a few minutes before
   responding; think before you react.
 - Ask, don’t tell. (“What do you think about trying…?” rather than
   “Don’t do…”) Explain your reasons why code should be changed. (Not in
   line with the style guide? A personal preference?)
 - Offer ways to simplify or improve code.
 - Avoid using derogatory terms, like “stupid”, when referring to the
   work someone has produced.
 - Be humble. (“I’m not sure, let’s try…”)
 - Avoid hyperbole. (“NEVER do…”)
 - Aim to develop professional skills, group knowledge and product
   quality, through group critique.
 - Be aware of negative bias with online communication. (If content is
   neutral, we assume the tone is negative.) Can you use positive
   language as opposed to neutral?
 - Use emoji to clarify tone. Compare “:sparkles: :sparkles: Looks good
   :+1: :sparkles: :sparkles:” to “Looks good.”

Responding to feedback
----------------------

 - Consider leading with an expression of appreciation, especially when
   feedback has been mixed.
 - Ask for clarification. ("I don’t understand, can you clarify?")
 - Offer clarification, explain the decisions you made to reach a
   solution in question. Try to respond to every comment.
 - Link to any follow up commits or Pull Requests. (“Good call! Done in
   1682851”)
 - If there is growing confusion or debate, ask yourself if the written
   word is still the best form of communication. Talk (virtually)
   face-to-face, then mutually consider posting a follow-up to summarize
   any offline discussion (useful for others who be following along, now
   or later).
